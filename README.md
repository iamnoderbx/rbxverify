A authentication website in which runs of React and Remix. This website also runs a server in parallel which powers a discord bot.

The website itself uses oAuth2 in order to register new accounts and connect a discord account to not only the web panel, but
also allows you to create verifications to different oAuth applications. In this case it uses ROBLOX oAuth.

This website was not finished, however the authentication and verifications were complete.

This is mainly useful for education purposes on running a server (such as a discord bot) alongside a React web application, and
creating symbolic links to communicate between the two.
